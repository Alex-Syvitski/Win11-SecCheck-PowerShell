# Win11-SecCheck-PowerShell
Windows 11 Security Checks for PowerShell. Designed for both local and mass network use.

There is commented out code to have output to a network path instead. This is meant for running on a domain and capturing alot of Windows devices, I expect it may work just fine on Win 10 and earlier but is untested. 

I've added detailed readme, and created an additive file for network usage as well as instructions.
